# Introduction
This repository contains a submodules of the popular [primer3](https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3) Git repository. In this repository, I , [@zjwinn](https://github.com/zjwinn), will be writing a pipeline which may be used to take a properly formatted variant calling format (VCF) file and a reference genome (e.g., [Chinese Spring RefSeq V2.1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15289))output potential Kompetative allele specific primer ([KASP](https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/education/kasp-genotyping-reagents/how-does-kasp-work)) designs for biallelic single nucleotide polymoprhisms (SNPs). The purpose of this repository is to create an exicutable batch file (.sh) which can be called upon to design KASP automatically for mapping population or genome-wide marker panels.
